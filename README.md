## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

HTML CSS and FLEXBOX

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="price-tag">
  <h1>$149.99</h1>
  <p>169.99</p>
</div>
```

```css
.price-tag {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
  font-family: "Fraunces", serif;
  padding-bottom: 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

I hope in the next project i can make more perfect, currently i'm still learning about HTML CSS and Flexbox.
